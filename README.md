# NearField_RIS

# Functions
- antennacorr.m: It is to understand how two distance on the same angle point lose their correlation. 
- AzElGraph.m: It plots set of angles that leads to orthogonal beams. Figure [] in the paper. 
- BeamWidth.m: It plots a figure where we understand that moving toward edges the beam gets wider and stretched in near field region. 
- BestCodeBook.m: It plots 3D figure where we understand what is the best initialization angle to generate the code book. Figure [] in the paper.
- ChanParGen.m: 
- distanceCorr.m:
